Pac-Man Game ðŸŽ®
Pac-Man is a classic arcade game originally developed by Namco and released in 1980. The game quickly became one of the most iconic and influential video games of all time, thanks to its simple yet engaging gameplay and charming design.

Gameplay
In Pac-Man, players control a yellow, circular character with a big mouth who navigates through a maze filled with dots. The objective is to eat all the dots in the maze while avoiding being caught by four ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.

Key Features:
Power Pellets: Special larger dots located in the maze. Eating them temporarily turns the ghosts blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for extra points.
Maze Navigation: The player must strategically navigate the maze to eat all dots while avoiding being trapped by the ghosts.
Increasing Difficulty: As the game progresses, the ghosts become faster and smarter, making it more challenging
